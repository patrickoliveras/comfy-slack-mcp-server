# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security issue, please **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

Instead, use one of these options:

- **Preferred**: open a GitHub Security Advisory (private) for this repository.
- If that’s not available, contact the maintainers via the email listed in the npm package metadata.

Please include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Any relevant logs or proof-of-concept
- Suggested remediation (if you have one)

## Supported versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest released version. If you need a backport, mention it in your report.

## Update log

- 2026-01-22: Added `SECURITY.md` and the preferred reporting channel.
